Objective: The main objective of this project is to forecast yearlong demand of an agricultural product. This would help farmers manage risk and fix the market price for the product in the market based on the harvest

1.Built a multi-level forecasting engine to obtain yearlong forecasts for an agricultural product in 10 different regions using 
univariate and multivariate statistical models

2. I have used MAPE score and R2 score as my performance metrics. 

4. Determined the econometric indicators (Temperature, Soil Moisture, Average Precipitation) for each region; predicted the
future trends for these indicators. Forecasting these exogenous variables also can help farmers prepare better for rainfall and droughts.

5. Hyperparameter tuning is done for statistical models using grid search and stationary test.

6. The best model for each region is choosen and the final forecasts are generated. The entire process is automated.
